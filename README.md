- 🔭 I’m currently working on a small device called [MorseListening](https://github.com/JJ1SLR/MorseListening). I'm an Amateur First-Class Radio Operator (第1級アマチュア無線技士) in Japan, and I need to practise myself to communicate with other amateur radio stations in Morse Code.
  - The basic functions are completed. Now it's on version V0.1.1. (Oct. 26, 2020)
